## Hi there, I'm Neil Agarwal ðŸ‘‹
Who I Am

Iâ€™m an Electrical and Computer Engineering student at UT Austin driven by a passion for embedded hardware, low-level programming, and IoT systems. I enjoy turning abstract ideas into working prototypes â€” whether that means writing interrupt-driven firmware, designing a PCB, or building a wireless robot from the ground up.

Areas I Work In

Microcontrollers & Firmware: Programming ESP32, STM32, MSPM0, and Arduino boards in C/C++ and Assembly, with a focus on peripheral integration and real-time control.

Connected Systems: Developing IoT solutions with cloud integration, Firebase, and wireless modules such as NRF24L01 and ESP8266.

Electronics & Hardware: Circuit design, PCB layout in KiCad, and debugging with oscilloscopes and lab instrumentation.

Control & Processing: Implementing motor control with PWM, signal filtering, and data acquisition pipelines using DMA and ADCs.

What I Know

Languages: Python, C, C++, Assembly, Verilog, HTML/CSS

Hardware Platforms: ESP32/ESP8266, STM32 Nucleo, Arduino, MSPM0G3507

Tools & Workflows: KiCad, Git/GitHub, Linux shell, Firebase, lab test equipment

Things Iâ€™ve Built

Roomable â€“ Smart occupancy monitoring platform combining ESP8266, Firebase, and a React Native mobile interface.

Byte Racers (RC Car) â€“ STM32-powered wireless vehicle with NRF24L01 communication, joystick transmitter, and H-bridge motor drivers.

BPM/SpOâ‚‚ Monitor â€“ ESP32 with custom analog front-end, WebSocket streaming, and accuracy within Â±3 BPM of a medical oximeter.

Custom PCBs â€“ Designed and tested multiple boards for power regulation, signal conditioning, and sensor integration.
